        <center><h1>Safety when traveling</h1><p>It should be noted that Denmark is generally a safe country, however you must be cautious and trust your gut feeling.<br>
        Furthermore police will never directly ask you for cash, or any other form of payment. Just like other countries<br> Denmark also has scam artists.
        It's advised to use caution when talking to people approaching you.</p>

    <center><h1>Payment and currency</h1><p>
            Denmark uses the Danish Krone(DKK) as their currency, this means that Euros will not be accepted in Denmark.<br>
            DKK can be purchased with a variety of foreign currency in multiple places in Denmark.<br>
            However you will most likely not need this as the preferred payment method in Denmark is card.<br>
            Most common cards like Mastercard, Visa and American express are accepted however China Unionpay is also accepted.
